📍 Toulouse, France | 🌍 Remote

🔭 I'm currently building DataRoom, a secure SaaS platform, while refining DevOps pipelines and Zero Trust architectures. 

🌱 I'm expanding my expertise in Kubernetes (K8s), Terraform, and automating infrastructure via IaC on Azure. 

👯 I'm open to collaborations on SaaS development, DevSecOps workflows, and modernizing IT operations through automation. 

💬 Let's talk about CI/CD strategies, building scalable SaaS architectures, Cloud Security, or how I leverage my background in SOC/Blue Team to secure modern applications.
